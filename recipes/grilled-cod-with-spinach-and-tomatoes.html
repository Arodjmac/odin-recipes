    <h4>I came up with this recipe because I could not find a recipe I was looking for. A very simple, easy, and quick dish to put together. I always make this for myself when I grill steaks for my family.</h4>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) fillet cod</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup roughly chopped spinach, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ tomato, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 slice mozzarella cheese, cut into cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Place cod on a piece of aluminum foil and season with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Top cod with spinach, tomato, and onion; season again with salt and black pepper. Drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar over cod and top with mozzarella cheese. Fold foil over cod creating a packet, crimping the edges together making a seal.</li>
        <li>Cook on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
